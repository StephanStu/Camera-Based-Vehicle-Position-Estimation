# Camera-based Vehicle-Position-Estimation
This is my capstone project in Udacity's C++ Nanodegree Program. This project contains an application that estimates the position of a road vehicle as it travels on a highway. The application generates an estimate of the state of the vehicle that may be fed to a driver assistant system or may be part of an autonomous driving system: An extended Kalman Filter estimates the position on the road and the velocities using "measurements" taken from a simple camera image. The architecture of this application is service-oriented, suitable for (Ubuntu) Linux and uses OpenCV and the Eigen-Library.

The application is shipped with sample images and sample videos for

* static testing of the Kalman Filter
* calibration of the camera
* videos to test the performance of the Kalman Filter with real-world data

in a save (cloud or desktop) Ubuntu-Linux Environment.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
This section lists the dependencies of the application &amp how to get them.

* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* OpenCV >= 4.1
  * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* Eigen-Library
  * Linux: Run chmod u+x installEigenLibrary.sh && ./installEigenLibrary.sh 

## Basic Build Instructions
This section explains how to build &amp deploy the application.  

1. Clone this repo.
2. Change the directory to the build directory: `cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./VBRPE`.
